# The `fetchcls` package

With standard LaTeX you are able to check for the class in use
invoking the kernel command `\@ifclassloaded`.
However, doing so you can't get the explicit class name
(unless you want to loop over every possible class name
until `\@ifclassloaded` returns true -- don't do that!)
With the present package you can get the name with significantly less effort.
Just load the package as usual:

    \begin{flushleft}
      \usepackage{fetchcls}
    end{flushleft}
    
Then, the control sequence `\classname` will hold the name of the current class.

This is version 1.0 of the package.
